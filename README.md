The Rmd file is used to demo the gallery feature in HTML files.

The original Rmd file `table-contest-rmd.Rmd` comes from ["Using gt, gtExtras and openair to present air quality monitoring data"](https://github.com/jack-davison/rstudio_table-contest_2021) RStudio Table Contest 2021.

I save the final R objects files in `our_table.rda` for demo purpose.

I create a small Rmd file `table-small-demo.Rmd` for the demo purpose. You can create the HTML file by Rscript -e "rmarkdown::knitr('table-small-demo.Rmd')" if your R have installed the required packages.
