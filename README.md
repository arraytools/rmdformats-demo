The Rmd file is used to demo the gallery feature in HTML files.

The original Rmd file `table-contest-rmd.Rmd` comes from ["Using gt, gtExtras and openair to present air quality monitoring data"](https://github.com/jack-davison/rstudio_table-contest_2021) RStudio Table Contest 2021.

I save the final R objects files in `our_table.rda` for demo purpose.

I create a small Rmd file `table-small-demo.Rmd` for the demo purpose. You can create the HTML output file `table-small-demo.html` by running `Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('table-small-demo.Rmd')"` in the command line or just knit the file assuming you have installed the required R packages.
